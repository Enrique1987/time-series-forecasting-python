## Time Series Inteview Questions.

#### What is meant by the term White noise ?

A Time series with White noise is a sequence of random numbers that cannot be predicted.

#### What is referred to as "Random Walk" ?

Random Walk is a tool taht can help use to understand the predicatility of our time series problem.

#### What is the difference between Random Walk and White noise ?

Ranom Walk is differnt from a list of random numbers because the next value in the sequence is a modification of the previous value in the sequence.

#### What is autocorrelation ?

Autocorrelation is the correlation between each observation and the observation at previous time steps.

#### What is sationary in TS ?

#### What indicate the Dickey-Fuller  test ?

The null hypotesis from Fuller test is that the Time Sereis is non-stationary, therefore a p > 0.05 will confirm the null hypotesis.

#### In which components can you decompose a Time Series ?

I will make the distintion between "Systematic" wich have consistence and recurence and can be described and modeled and "non-systematic" components which can not be modeled.

- Systematic: Trend, level and Sesionality
- Non-Systematic: nosie
